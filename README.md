# Enhanced-IEEE-39-Bus-System-with-Inverter-based-Resources-on-Multi-Time-Scale-Platforms
This repository contains the data for enhanced IEEE 39-Bus System with Inverter Based Resources (IBRs) built on multi-time-scale platforms. The IEEE 39-Bus test system is modified by adjusting various model parameters based on recent industry practices and integrating with IBRs to reflect accurate grid characteristics for power system phasor-based dynamics and electro-magnetic transient (EMT) studies. The enhanced IEEE 39-Bus test system is validated in various commercial tools like PSSE, PSLF and PSCAD.

The information contained in each folder in the repository is listed as follows:
•	Enhanced IEEE 39-Bus System
